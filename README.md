Mod for Persona 5 Royal (PC) that makes the infamous Okumura boss super easy.

## What It Does

- Removes the two-turn limit for enemy waves
- Removes all attacks from enemies

### What it doesn't do

- Removes the timer (I haven't figured out how to do that yet, sorry)

## y tho

Okay. I know it sounds like I'm making it _too_ easy now. I know. But I was completely fed up with this boss and wanted to just move on. The challenge wasn't fun anymore to me. The game itself became not fun anymore. I'm guessing there are others out there like me. I went weeks without playing because I couldn't get past the damn boss. That's no way to enjoy a video game.

This mod is for people, like me, who have done multiple attempts at this boss and are still unsuccessful. We want to just get on with the story and don't want to "git gud". Not everybody enjoys games the same way, and that's okay.

## Installation

This mod makes use of [Persona Essentials (aka p5rpc.modloader)](https://github.com/Sewer56/p5rpc.modloader) and [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) (both by @Sewer56). You'll want to get both of those installed.

- [Steam Deck/Linux Reloaded II installation guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/ychwxw/persona_5_royal_reloadedii_mod_guide_for_steam/)

Once you get through that, just download the latest [p5rpc.cheap.easierokumura.zip from the Releases](https://github.com/sapslaj/p5r-easier-okumura/releases/latest) and extract it into the Mods folder of Reloaded II.
